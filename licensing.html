<h2>How do you give people permission to use this data?</h2>
<p>In the Licensing section of the Open Data Certificate questionnaire, you answer one or more questions about how your data is licensed so others can use it. The questions you are shown are based on your answers to previous questions - the logic is shown in this <a href="http://queensland.theodi.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2016/12/certificate-licencing-flowchart-2016-12-08.pdf">flowchart</a>.</p>

<p id="copyrightURL">&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="question">1. Where have you published the rights statement for this dataset?</h2>
<p>Provide the URL to a page that describes the right to re-use this dataset. This should include a reference to its <a href="http://queensland.theodi.org/home/glossary/#licence">licence</a> or copyright <a href="http://queensland.theodi.org/home/glossary/#waiver">waiver</a>, <a href="http://queensland.theodi.org/home/glossary/#attribution">attribution</a> requirements, and a statement about relevant copyright. A rights statement helps people understand what they can and can't do with the data.</p>
<h3 class="answer">Rights Statement URL</h3>
<div class="next">
  <a title="Is there any copyright this data?" href="#contentRights">Next: Question 2</a>
</div>
<div class="note">
<p>Enter the web address (url) of the page that provides copyright and license information. You can often find it on:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>the page where you access the data. e.g. the page may display, Licence: <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution</a> or show <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"><img alt="Creative Commons License" style="border-width:0" src="https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by/4.0/80x15.png" /></a></li>
    <li>the site's "Copyright" or "Terms and Conditions" page; often accessible via the page footer. e.g. Moreton Bay Regional Council's website <a href="https://www.moretonbay.qld.gov.au/copyright/">Copyright page</a>.</li>
    <li>the site's "About" page.</li>
  </ul>
<p>If your data is available in a CKAN open data portal, this question will be automatically answered for you.</p>

<p>This rights statement applies to the whole dataset. If your data includes third-party data, then you should also provide a statement about the third-party copyright nested within the dataset. You'll be asked about this later in the questionnaire.</p>
</div>


<p id="contentRights">&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="question">2. Is there any copyright in this data?</h2>
<h3 class="answer">No, the data only contains facts and numbers.</h3>
<p>There is no copyright in factual information. If the data does not contain any content that was created through intellectual effort, there are no rights in the content.</p>
<div class="note">
<p>Copyright only applies to data if you spent intellectual effort creating what's in it, for example, by writing text that's within the data, or deciding whether particular data is included. There's no copyright if the data only contains facts where no judgements were made about whether to include them or not.</p>
</div>
<div class="next">
  <a title="Is the data marked as Public Domain?" href="#explicitWaiver">Next: Question 3</a>
</div>
<h3>Yes, and the rights are all held by the same person or organisation</h3>
<p>Choose this option if the content in the data was all created by or transferred to the same person or organisation.</p>
<div class="next">
  <a title="Under which licence or waiver can people reuse this data?" href="#contentLicence">Next: Question 4</a>
</div>
<h3>Yes, and the rights are held by different people or organisations</h3>
<p>In some data, the rights in different records are held by different people or organisations. You should keep track of who has rights and to what within a dataset, where third party rights exist. Information about third party rights should be included in documentation attached to the dataset.</p>
<div class="next">
  <a title="Where are the rights and licencing of third-party data explained?" href="#contentRightsURL">Next: Question 11</a>
</div>


<p id="explicitWaiver">&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="question">3. Is the data marked as Public Domain?</h2>
<p>Works in the public domain are those whose intellectual property rights have expired, have been forfeited, or are inapplicable. If none of the content of your data have copyright or other rights over it, it is good practice to explicitly state this by labelling it as ‘public domain’. You can do this by using the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/">Creative Commons Public Domain Mark</a> or a <a href="http://www.ausgoal.gov.au/no-copyright">no known rights statement</a>.</p>
<h3 class="answer">Yes</h3>
<div class="next">
  <a title="Do you have a machine-readable rights statement?" href="#copyrightStatementMetadata">Next: Question 12</a>
</div>
<h3 class="answer">No</h3>
<div class="next">
  <a title="Do you have a machine-readable rights statement?" href="#copyrightStatementMetadata">Next: Question 12</a>
</div>
<div class="warning">
<p>Should this text should only focus on no copyright rather than waived or expired copyright (as these are covered elsewhere). The downside of this is that data with expired copyright cannot earn Gold as the question, "is the data marked as public domain" is not asked. </p>
</div>
<div class="warning">
<p>If we keep the current wording, should we change:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Works in the public domain are those whose intellectual property rights have expired, have been forfeited, or are inapplicable.</li>
  <li>to</li>
  <li>Works in the public domain are those whose copyright has expired, has been waived, or there is no copyright in the data.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="warning">
<p>Should we explain "or other rights over it" in "If none of the content of your data have copyright or other rights over it, it is good practice to explicitly state this by labelling it as ‘public domain’."?</p>
</div>

<div class="warning">
<p>Creative Commons seems to <a href="https://creativecommons.org/about/pdm/">emphasise</a> using PDM for works with expired copyright or already in the public domain. Is this mark appropriate for all data placed in the public domain? E.g. Is it applicable for adding to raw data collected from sensors where there is no copyright?</p>
</div>


<p id="contentLicence">&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="question">4. Under which licence or waiver can people reuse this data?</h2>
<p>Remember that whoever spends intellectual effort creating content automatically gets rights over it. Creative content includes the organisation and selection of items within data, but does not include facts. You need to provide a waiver or a licence which informs people how they can legally use the data.</p>
<p>We list the most common licenses used in Australia.</p>

<p>If you aren't sure what an open licence is, then read the <a href="http://opendefinition.org/">Open Definition</a> by <a href="http://okfn.org/">Open Knowledge</a>. Review the <a href="http://opendefinition.org/licenses/">Open Definition Conformant Licences</a> to check if your licence is open. If your licence isn't listed, it's either not open or hasn't been assessed yet.</p>
<h3 class="answer">Yes</h3>
<p>Answer, "Yes" if your licence is listed as open on the <a href="http://opendefinition.org/licenses/">Open Definition Conformant Licences</a> list.</p>
<div class="next">
  <a title="Do you have a machine-readable rights statement?" href="#copyrightStatementMetadata">Next: Question 12</a>

<div class="note">
<p>The CC0 is a document in which the user purports to abandon all claim to copyright and related rights. It is not a licence. Whilst you could apply a CC0 Waiver, there are some doubts about its force under Australian law, particularly with respect to <a href="http://queensland.odinodes.wpengine.com/home/glossary#moral-rights">moral rights</a>. Furthermore, the disclaimer that accompanies CC0, at present, may be ineffective in protecting the user from liability for claims of negligence.</p>

<p id="contentRightsURL">&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="question" id="contentRightsURL">11. Where are the rights and licencing of third-party data explained?</h2>
<p>Give the URL for a page where you describe how someone can find out the rights and licensing of third-party data nested within the dataset.</p>

<p>In some data, the rights in different records are held by different people or organisations. Where these nested rights carry different restrictions, the dataset will inherit, in total, the most restrictive of the nested restrictions.</p>

<p>For example, if two nested elements of data are licensed CC-BY and CC-BY-NC, the entire dataset will need to be licensed CC-BY-NC, which by definition would prevent it from being ‘open’ data. There may be an exception to this rule if the user can clearly identify the nested data elements and the restrictions that apply to them.</p>
